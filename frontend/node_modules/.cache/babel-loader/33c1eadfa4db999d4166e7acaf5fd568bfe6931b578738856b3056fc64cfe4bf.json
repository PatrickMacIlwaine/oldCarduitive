This game caters to 2 to 4 players and challenges you with a deck of cards numbered 1-100. Your task is to play these cards in ascending order, working collaboratively with your fellow players, while the contents of your hand remain a secret. The game begins with each player receiving a random assortment of cards. Keep in mind the key rule of CARDUITIVE: the order matters. To play a card from your hand, click on it. However, make sure your choice doesn't violate the ascending order of play. For instance, playing a 45 before a 10 is a grave mistake and leads to an immediate end of the game. It's essential to strategize and time your moves to perfection. Victory in CARDUITIVE is won not by individual triumph but by team success. When all players have successfully laid down their cards in the correct order, from 1 through 100, you achieve collective victory. Remember, teamwork, intuition, and strategy are at the heart of CARDUITIVE. Enjoy the thrill of strategizing and the suspense of the unknown as you navigate through the game.
